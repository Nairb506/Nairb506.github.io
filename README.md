Milestone Two: Pet Class Enhancement
Brian Chmura
1. Briefly Describe the Artifact
The artifact I selected for enhancement is the Pet Class, originally written in Java during my IT-145 course, which I completed about a year ago. The class was part of a Pet Check-In project that allowed users to input standard information about a pet, such as its name, age, breed, and the kennel it would stay in. This project introduced me to basic object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation and class design.
2. Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio
I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it highlights several essential skills in software development, including object-oriented programming, class design, and cross-language adaptation. The original project incorporated various stages of the software design process, from writing pseudocode to mapping out logic flow using flowcharts and finally implementing the solution in Java.
The enhancement I made involved rewriting the Pet Class in Python, which showcases my proficiency in multiple programming languages. This improvement not only demonstrates my ability to work with Python but also reflects my understanding of core programming concepts that apply across languages, such as data structures, syntax differences, and efficient code implementation. Additionally, this enhancement required adjusting the class design to suit Python’s structure and syntax, which improved both the readability and efficiency of the code.
3. Course Objectives and Outcome-Coverage Plans
Yes, I believe I met the course objectives I initially set out to achieve with this enhancement. In Module One, my plan was to enhance the code by improving functionality and efficiency. However, after reviewing the original code, I decided that rewriting the Java code in Python would be a more valuable enhancement.
Rewriting the Pet Class in Python not only met the objectives but also exceeded them, as it allowed me to demonstrate cross-language proficiency. This update also showcased improvements in code compilation speed and overall efficiency, which were noticeable in Python compared to Java. Going forward, my outcome-coverage plan will reflect this cross-language adaptation as part of the enhancement, as it enhances the project’s relevance and my skill set.
4. Reflection on the Enhancement Process
Through this enhancement process, I gained deeper insights into the differences between programming languages, particularly in terms of syntax and performance. Python, with its clean and concise syntax, proved to be a versatile and efficient language for this type of project. The process of rewriting the Pet Class in Python highlighted the importance of adaptable programming skills and cross-language problem-solving abilities.
One of the main challenges I faced during this enhancement was converting some of the Java syntax into Python. For example, Python handles methods and attributes differently than Java, particularly in how it manages data encapsulation and class structures. To overcome these challenges, I referred to Python documentation and relied on trial and error to ensure that the code maintained its functionality while adhering to Python's best practices. This process reinforced my problem-solving skills and adaptability, especially when transitioning between different programming environments.

1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I’ve chosen to enhance is a Hash Table Algorithm from my Data Structures and Algorithms course (CS-260), which I completed more than two years ago. A hash table is a data structure that stores information using a key-value system, where each data value is assigned a unique index within an array, making data retrieval more efficient.
2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it aligns with key concepts from CS-260, including algorithmic design and the evaluation of complex data structures. This artifact showcases my ability to work with advanced data structures and demonstrates my understanding of algorithm efficiency. I improved the artifact by rewriting the original C++ code into Python, which involved adjusting syntax and resolving errors, thereby enhancing both the functionality and readability of the code.
3. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, I believe I met the course objectives, particularly CS-499-03 and CS-499-04. During the enhancement process, I employed development best practices, such as writing pseudocode to map out complex logic and performing incremental debugging to isolate and resolve errors. I plan to update my outcome-coverage plan to include testing and debugging strategies, as these were critical in delivering a working Python implementation of the hash table.

CS 499 Milestone 4
Brian Chmura
Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact that I've chosen to enhance is a SQL database .csv file from my DAD 220 course two years ago. The portion of the database that I will be enhancing is the "employees" table. This table contains the names, salaries, security access level, and employment status of all the employees in the company.
Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I've chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because of think that it aligned greatly with the overall objective to meet the requirements for the final project. I selected the employee Human Resources portion of the SQL database because I thought it would be a challenge as well as a great way to learn new development concepts that I have never explored before. The specific component of the HR database artifact showcases my knowledge of SQL and database integration. I improved the artifact by creating a user simple user interface that takes the prompted values and stores them In the MongoDB cloud database which I integrated using HTML, JavaScript, Express, and Node. JS.
Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, specifically CS-499-03, and CS-499-04. The reason being is because although the application is simply designed, I had to consider taking a very logic approach as to how achieve my goal of creating a front end to take the Human Resources information and link it to a
MongoDB data that can queried. I also to a semi-testing route by setting up nodemon a tool within node. JS to run the database connection processes along error checking hard code into my index.js file.
Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
When it came to enhancing my artifact from DAD 220 course, I didn’t really understand the undertaking it would be to get everything about my enhancement working the way I wanted. I started this enhancement with a .csv file for the HR and Information Systems department for the lab. It only contained the names and which department the employee worked but I feel that was more than enough information to lay the groundwork, which entailed configuring my database via the shell, and the writing the database connection code in JavaScript which I am not well-versed in. Next, I wrote the code that would essentially talk to the HTML code outlining what input information to prompt the user for. I learned throughout this enhancement that falling back on the foundation concepts of design a crucial when starting any application project. The challenges I faced were mainly some logic errors dealing with the JavaScript code as well as database connection issues between the code and the application itself not submitting the input information my database.
